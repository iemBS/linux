Mount Drive
Note:
  - Guidance from https://askubuntu.com/questions/125257/how-do-i-add-an-additional-hard-drive
  - Guidance from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingANewHardDrive
Preconditions:
  - Drive is already installed on machine
  - Assume new partition is /dev/sdb1
  - Use SSD disk for OS to make OS faster
  - Use HDD for files because more reliable than SSD
  - "hdd" folder & access point for addition drive is at the top level
  - Using Nano file editor
  - Normal user granted ability to create files on new drive is "ckent"
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Open user friendly tool
       sudo gparted
  2. In tool, make one single partition of "ext4" type
  3. Show list of drives and partitions on drives
       sudio fdisk -l
  4. display results to screen (example below)
        Disk /dev/sda: 250.1 GB, 250059350016 bytes
        ....

        Disk /dev/sdb: 2000.4 GB, 2000398934016 bytes
        255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 243201 cylinders
        Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
        Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
        I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
        Disk identifier: 0x000814e3

           Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  Syste
        /dev/sdb1               1      243201  1953512001   83  Linux
  5. create mount point
       sudo mkdir /hdd
  6. Edit /etc/fstab with root permissions
       sudo nano -Bw /etc/fstab
  7. Add the following to the end of the file
       /dev/sdb1    /hdd    ext4    defaults    0    0
  8. Mount partition
       sudo mount /hdd
  9. Allow normal users to create file on the new drive
       sudo chown -R ckent:ckent /hdd
